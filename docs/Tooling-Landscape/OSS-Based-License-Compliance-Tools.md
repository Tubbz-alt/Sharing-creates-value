## Introduction

Open source software has eaten the world, but organizations are still struggling with effective compliance. Open source software is heterogenous and re-used, which, while positive for software development, creates a challenge for compliance. Compliance requires multiple tools and these should be ideally combined into a workflow that supports a number of business and developer requirements. One of the requirements is ease of use in a modern development environment where code development cycles are getting ever shorter and new development results are pushed to operations ever faster. For this to work, open source compliance tools likely need to integrate with development tooling.

In the following report some of these tools are listed with information of their main license, website and a summary of their features, based on accounts by the projects. The report has been crafted to map out the wide range of open source tools that one might use to help keep their open source software compliant. However, this report, ever so comprehensive, is not exhaustive. The report includes FOSS tools as well as a few commercial tools. It also has a section for Open Source Initiatives and Development Environments, as these are  also important on a way towards automated open compliance with open tooling and open data. 

This report will be complemented based on an ecosystem survey and on practical testing of the most popular open source tools.

This report is part of the first work package in the Double Open project. See [doubleopen.org](https://doubleopen.org) for more details.

Tern is a software package inspection tool for containers written in Python. Tern is an inspection tool to find the metadata of the packages installed in a container image. It does this in two steps:

1. It uses overlayfs to mount the first filesystem layer in a container image
2. It then executes scripts from the "command library" in a chroot environment to collect information about packages installed in that layer
3. With that information as a base, it continues to iterate over step 1 and 2 for the rest of the layers in the container image
4. Once done, it generates a report in different formats. The default report is a verbose explanation of what layers brought in what software components. If a Dockerfile is provided then it will also provide what lines in the Dockerfile was used to create the layers.

As such, it addresses the OWASP Top 10 security risk A9, Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities, which is often the root cause of data breaches.
